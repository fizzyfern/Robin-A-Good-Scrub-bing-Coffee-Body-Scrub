A Good ‘Scrub’bing – Coffee Body Scrub
Our skin is exposed to a lot of unhealthy particles and it absorbs a lot of these toxins. While it is not possible to know exactly how much the skin takes in but it is definitely necessary to remove these impurities. There is a reason therefore that the best spas use a coffee body scrub in their treatments – coffee bean grounds are extremely beneficial for the skin. Not only does a good ‘scrub’bing rejuvenate and refresh the skin immediately on use, over time they help with repairing and strengthening the skin. Why you might ask – well because coffee is brimming with antioxidants that eliminate and fight toxins when used as a scrub (of course drinking coffee helps too – in moderation!) These antioxidants fight and rid the body of the highly chemically reactive oxygen molecules, also known as free radicals and the more antioxidants you can get the better it is for the overall health of the body. Natural products incorporate antioxidants present in nature and help you to steer clear of harmful chemicals. You should know what is going on and into your skin through your coffee body scrub – read on. Coffee beans alone cannot provide the all-round care and moisturizing your body needs, but when complemented with other bounties of nature, toxins and impurities get a thorough ‘scrub’bing!
Coffee Beans
Coffee is naturally full of nutrients and antioxidants that help to scrub away dullness, dryness, and puffiness. These super powerful beans also protect the skin from harmful UV sun rays, and fight bacteria that causes skin breakout such as acne. 
Frankincense Oil
This beautifully fragrant oil not only soothes irritated skin but also helps to calm and soothe the mind. It helps to hydrate and care for prematurely ageing skin leaving it healthy, even-toned, and aromatically supple. 
Walnut Shell Powder
This ingredient complements the efforts of the exfoliation provided by coffee beans, which is necessary for the skin to fully absorb moisturizing and anti-ageing treatments. This in turn ensures that dullness, patches, dark spots, and other forms of skin challenges are removed with each scrub. 

Sesame Oil 

Loaded with the goodness of zinc this natural oil is especially good for calming and healing irritated and damaged skin. Sesame is naturally rich in antioxidants and is brimming with antibacterial properties. 

Almond Oil 

Vitamins are essential for the body, and this oil is packed with vitamins that keep the skin cells healthy by protecting them from sun ray and other environmental damage. It also gently moisturizes the exfoliated skin from the scrubbing agents in a coffee body scrub. 



Aloe Vera 

Nature has blessed us with so many gifts, and aloe vera is on such acne fighting and effectively moisturizing element. It complements the efforts of the exfoliation and leaves skin feeling soft and radiantly healthy. 

Wrapping Up

With all the properties and benefits of a coffee body scrub regularly (at least 2-3 times a week) and yes over your entire body, and then gloat over how gossamer and supple your body will feel. As an added tip, we recommend paying particularly close attention to your elbows, knees, and heels since these are three areas on the body that dry out more easily and faster than other parts, and could sure use some extra tender loving care.
